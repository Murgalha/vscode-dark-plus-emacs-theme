<p align="center">A complete port of the default Visual Studio Code Dark+ theme for Emacs</p>

<br/>

#### Introduction:

This theme aims to be **as identical as possible** to the default Dark+ color scheme used by Visual Studio Code. To see the original Visual Studio Code by Microsoft in action, consider [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnPhJHN0jTE).

If you find an inconsistency between Visual Studio Code's Dark+ and my port, please **file an issue** and I'll try my best to fix it.

#### Note:

This is the default Visual Studio Code Dark+ theme (the more **colorful** one), if you're looking for the **more minimal Dark** theme, it's [here](https://github.com/ianpan870102/vscode-dark-emacs-theme).


#### Installation Method 1: MELPA

WIP. My package is currently waiting for MELPA maintainers' review.


#### Installation Method 2: manual install

Download `vscode-dark-plus-theme.el` and put it under `~/.emacs.d/themes/` (or `~/.config/emacs/themes/`), then add these lines to your `init.el`:

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
# or
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.config/emacs/themes/")

(load-theme 'vscode-dark-plus t)
```

#### Installation Method 3: `use-package` & `straight`

Requires [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) and [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el)
Add these lines to your 'init.el':
```
(use-package vscode-dark-plus-theme
  :straight (:host github :repo "ianpan870102/vscode-dark-plus-emacs-theme")
